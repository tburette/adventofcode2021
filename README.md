# Advent of code 2021 (javascript)
This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) coding challenge.  
The challenge has a ranking based on speed of completion. The code in this repository was written to get the result as fast as possible. As such the code is quite terrible : not well designed, structured or commented,...
I use this challenge to learn/practice my Javascript abilities.
